## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Got a better understanding on how to use the fetch function in JavaScript.

### Continued development

Add a form to change the hours, or some wait to edit the JSON without going into the file and manually changing it.
Maybe making an app that tracks in.
